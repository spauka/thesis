Throughout this Ph.D., the quest to build a quantum computer has accelerated, driven by ever-improving
fidelities of conventional qubits, such as spins and transmons, and the development of new techologies
that promise topologically protected qubits with the potential for lifetimes that exceed those of any comparable
qubit today. As such, there has been an explosion of interest in the design of an architecture for a
quantum computer. This would have to be a design that not only includes high-quality qubits at the bottom of the stack,
but also one that is extensible and allows layout of many qubits with scalable methods for readout and
control of the entire device. Furthermore, the entire experimental infrastructure must handle the requirements for parallel operation
of many qubits in the system. Hence the crux of this thesis: to design an architecture for a semiconductor-based
quantum computer that encompasses all elements that would be required to build a large scale quantum machine.

This idea is surveyed from the top down. In Chapter~\ref{sec:arch}, I explore the key elements of the
architecture of a quantum computer. I define a common structure by which we can compare the control
and readout hardware for any given design, following which I present two potential architectures for
a quantum computer: one that multiplexes both readout and control from room-temperature to \SI{4}{\kelvin} in
Sec.~\ref{sec:primelines}, followed by one which uses {CryoCMOS} to generate control pulses near the qubits
in Sec.~\ref{sec:gooseberry}.

In Chapter~\ref{sec:hall}, I move up the stack and present a set of experiments concerning the design and
implementation of circulators based on the quantum Hall effect (Sec.~\ref{sec:hallcirc}) and the
anomalous quantum Hall effect (Sec.~\ref{sec:spinhallcirc}). Circulators are vital components in qubit
experiments, used to route signals and isolate qubits from thermal photons, however, are currently bulky,
centimeter-scale devices. By capacitively coupling to the edge magnetoplasmon modes of micron-scale Hall droplets,
I demonstrate non-reciprocal transmission with isolation similar to that of off-the-shelf components.

In Chapter~\ref{sec:spinqubit}, I explore the design of the spin qubit and examine the dispersive gate sensing technique,
which holds promise as a scalable method of readout for large arrays of quantum dots. First, in Sec.~\ref{sec:5dot},
the scalable design for a singlet-triplet qubit is proposed, which allows for the layout of larger arrays of qubits
while proposing a method for two-qubit coupling over intermediate length scales via an intermediate quantum state.
Then, in Sec.~\ref{sec:pockets}, I inspect anomalous signals present in dispersive gate sensors, proposing that they
are caused by localized pockets of charge that form in the 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). These pockets of charge may
contribute to the charge-noise that plagues semiconductor based qubits.

Finally, in Chapter~\ref{sec:majoinas}, I study the formation of Majorana zero modes in InAs nanowires and
2DEGs and the experimental challenges of realizing a qubit based on topological qubits. In Sec.~\ref{sec:rfmajo}, I investigate
techniques for finding and reading out Majorana zero modes and present benchmarks on the current
generation of charge sensors in nanowires. In Sec.~\ref{sec:inas_hb}, I propose techniques for improving the quality
of shallow InAs 2DEG's after processing, which remains a limiting factor in the design of qubits based on Majorana zero
modes in InAs.
