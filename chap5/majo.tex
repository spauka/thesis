\begin{abstract}
Radio-frequency (rf) reflectometry is implemented in hybrid semiconductor-superconductor nanowire systems designed to probe Majorana zero modes. Two approaches are presented. In the first, hybrid nanowire-based devices are part of a resonant circuit, allowing conductance to be measured as a function of several gate voltages $sim 40$ times faster than using conventional low-frequency lock-in methods. In the second, nanowire devices are capacitively coupled to a nearby RF single-electron transistor made from a separate nanowire, allowing RF detection of charge, including charge-only measurement of the crossover from $2e$ inter-island charge transitions at zero magnetic field to $1e$ transitions at axial magnetic fields above \SI{0.6}{\tesla}, where a topological state is expected. Single-electron sensing yields signal-to-noise exceeding 3 and visibility $99.8\%$ for a measurement time of \SI{1}{\micro\second}.

Solid-state quantum computation schemes that involve repeated measurement and feedback, including topological schemes \cite{AasenPRX16, PhysRevB.94.235446, Plugge, PhysRevB.95.235305} with potentially long coherence times \cite{Non-Abelian, Alicea_2012}, nonetheless require fast read-out of charge or current in order to operate on reasonable time scales \cite{Reiher7555}. For topological qubits based on Majorana modes in nanowires (NWs) with proximity-induced superconductivity, quasiparticle poisoning of Majorana modes constrains read-out times to microseconds or faster \cite{Lossqpp}, as has already been demonstrated for superconducting \cite{SCq3,SCq2,SCq1,SCq4} and spin qubits \cite{Reilley1,sensingdot,petta,RevModPhys.79.1217}.

Here, we report the realization of radio-frequency (rf) reflectometry in various configurations of InAs nanowires (NWs) with epitaxial Al, fabricated to form single or coupled Majorana islands, with and without proximal NW charge sensors. The device geometries are inspired by recent theoretical proposals for demonstrating elementary topological qubit operations in these systems \cite{AasenPRX16, PhysRevB.94.235446, Plugge, PhysRevB.95.235305}. Two approaches to fast measurements are investigated in detail. In the first, a resonator made from a cryogenic inductor and capacitor is coupled directly to the leads of the device \cite{karl1,PhysRevLett.109.166804,karl3}, providing a conductance measurement similar to what is obtained with a low-frequency (LF) lock-in amplifier, though considerably faster. In the second, a similar resonator is capacitively coupled to a proximal NW charge sensor configured for both LF and rf charge read-out. The overall charge sensitivity is investigated as a function of the measurement time and is found to yield a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for single-charge detection exceeding 3 and a visibility of $99.8\%$ for an integration time of \SI{1}{\micro\second}, with correspondingly higher values for longer integration times. Proximal NW charge sensors are found to be compatible with magnetic fields exceeding \SI{1}{\tesla}, the range needed to reach the topological regime \cite{Mourik1003,MT1,nature26142,AlbretchNature}. All measurements are carried out in a dilution refrigerator (Oxford Instruments Triton 400) a base temperature of approximately \SI{20}{\mk}, equipped with a 6-1-1~\si{\tesla} vector magnet.

\subsection{Experimental setup}

The reflectometry signal is optimized by matching the circuit impedance $Z$, including the device resistance $R_\textrm{dev}$, to the characteristic impedance of the transmission line, $Z_0 = \SI{50}{\ohm}$. Near matching, the reflection coefficient of the resonant circuit, ($Z-Z_{0}$)/($Z+Z_{0}$), is sensitive to small changes in $R_\textrm{dev}$ \cite{Reilly:2007ig,PhysRevApplied.5.034011}. To enable multiple simultaneous measurements, four rf resonant circuits with different discrete inductances in the range $L = $\SIrange{1.2}{4.7}{\micro\henry} are coupled to a single-directional coupler via a coupling capacitor, $C$. One such resonant circuit is depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_a} (a). It consists of a ceramic-core chip inductor\footnote{Electronic Access: https://www.coilcraft.com},  a parasitic capacitance, $C_P$, from bond wires and on-chip metal electrodes, and the device, with $R_\textrm{dev}$ tuned by the gate voltages. The parasitic capacitance is found to be unchanged over several cool-downs.

LF lock-in measurements of differential conductance $g = \textrm{d}I/\textrm{d}V|_{V_\textrm{bias}}$ of either the device or the sensor are carried out in a two-wire voltage-bias configuration using a transimpedance (current-to-voltage) amplifier\footnote{Low Noise, High Stability I to V Converter (SP 983). Electronic access: https://www.physik.unibas.ch} connected to the drain of the device, providing voltage input to a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research SR830). The voltage bias consists of a dc component, $V_\textrm{bias}$, and a LF component in the range of \SIrange{4}{10}{\micro\volt} at frequencies below \SI{200}{\hertz}.

Reflectometry measurements of either the device or the sensor are performed as follows. A rf carrier at frequency $f$ with amplitude $V_\textrm{TX}$ is applied to the source lead following a series of attenuators at various temperature stages [Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_a} (a)], giving a total of \SI{21}{\decibel} of attenuation, with an additional \SI{15}{\decibel} of attenuation from the directional coupler, mounted below the mixing chamber plate. After reflection from the device, the signal passes back through the directional coupler into a cryogenic amplifier (Caltech CITLF3; noise temperature $T_{n} =  \SI{4}{\kelvin}$ from \SI{10}{\mega\hertz} to \SI{2}{\giga\hertz}) with \SI{+40}{\decibel} of gain.  The output signal, $V_\textrm{RX}$, is then detected using one of three methods: (1) using a network analyzer to measure $S_{21}\equiv 20 \log (V_\textrm{RX}/V_\textrm{TX})$ [Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_a} (c)]; (2) using discrete analog components to demodulate by standard homodyne detection, followed by a fast-sampling oscilloscope (for details see Appendix \ref{sec:majo_B}); (3) using a rf lock-in amplifier (Zurich Instruments UHFLI\footnote{Electronic Access: https://www.zhinst.com/products/uhfli}). Each method has its advantages. Method (1) is convenient for quickly determining  if a change in device resistance has an effect on the circuit impedance, which shows up as a change in the magnitude of $S_{21}$. Method (2) provides fast acquisition of phase maps at different gate configurations, particularly if the device is tuned into the regime of small charging energies. For these applications, methods (2) and (3) are comparable. Method (3) has advantages in simultaneously measuring the phase and magnitude of the reflected signal and is used to quantify SNR of the proximal NW sensors and to detect charge occupancy of Majorana islands tuned to low barrier transmission.

Figures 1(b-d) show a comparison of the LF lock-in measurement and the reflectometry measurement, $S_{21}(f)$, of conductance $g^{(S)}$ of a charge sensor as it is pinched off using electrostatic gates.  In the reflectometry measurement, $V_{RX}$ varies rapidly near the resonance frequency $f_{\rm res} \sim \SI{30}{\mega\hertz}$, yielding a dip in $S_{21}(f)$ that depends on the common gate voltage.  Line cuts of $S_{21}$ at different values of $V_{G^{*}}$ are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_a} (d).
The depth of the resonance changes by approximately \SI{21}{\decibel} as the sensor conductance, $g^{(S)}$, is decreased from 0.5 $e^{2}/h$ to 0.02 $e^{2}/h$. In this case, an increasing $R_\textrm{dev}$ moves the resonator impedance toward matching.

\subsection{Conductance: LF lock-in versus rf reflectometry}

Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_b} (a) shows a hybrid \ce{InAs}/\ce{Al} island (device A) defined by Ti/Au gates that wrap around the NW, isolated by \ce{HfO2} dielectric. Al is removed from the NW ends with wet etch leaving a continuous Al segment, where gates $L$ and $R$ set the boundaries of the island. Gate voltages $V_{L}$ and $V_{R}$ control coupling of the island to the leads, while three additional gates tune the chemical potential and density on different parts of the island (see Appendix \ref{sec:majo_D}). Only the gate marked $V_{\textrm{LP}}$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_b} (a) is used, with the others fixed at zero volts. A dc voltage $V_\textrm{bias}$ is applied to the left lead, while the right lead is connected to the rf circuit ($L = \SI{2.7}{\micro\henry}$, $f_\textrm{res} \sim \SI{52}{\mega\hertz}$) using method (2), described above. Simultaneous LF and rf measurements of the pinch-off characteristic of the right barrier with the left barrier fixed at $V_{L} \sim \SI{1}{\volt}$ are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_b} (b). At positive $V_{R}$, the right-hand side of the island is open and shows a positive demodulated voltage $V_\textrm{rf}$, while at negative $V_{R}$, the right junction is closed and no current can flow through the island. Overall, $V_\textrm{rf}$ is found to be proportional to $g$ measured with an LF lock-in, as shown in the inset of Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_b} (b).

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{Fig2-18.pdf}
	\caption[Conductance via lock-in versus lead reflectometry]{(a) A scanning electron micrograph of device A, a top-gated InAs/Al nanowire device, with the relevant gates labeled. The dashed white box indicates the Al island. (b) The zero bias pinch-off characteristic of the right barrier gate, $V_R$, as measured by conductance (red) and reflectometry (blue). The inset shows a parametric plot of the two traces. The coulomb-blockade diamonds are measured by conductance (c) and reflectometry (d). In both cases, the dependence on  the plunger voltage V$_\textrm{LP}$ is $1e$ periodic at high bias and $2e$ periodic at zero bias.}
	\label{fig:majo_b}
\end{figure}

Setting both barriers into the tunneling regime using $V_L$ and $V_R$ creates a Coulomb-blockaded island. A two-dimensional (2D) map of Coulomb diamonds as a function of $V_\textrm{bias}$ and the left plunger gate, V$_{\textrm{LP}}$, is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_b} (c) and Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_b} (d). At finite bias, $V_\textrm{bias} \geq \SI{0.2}{\milli\volt}$, above the superconducting gap of Al, conductance oscillations with a period of half the zero-bias period are found, characteristic of a superconducting island. At low bias, transport is via Cooper pairs, yielding $2e$ periodicity; at biases above the superconducting gap, $1e$ transport is available, halving the period.

The similarity of the LF lock-in and rf reflectometry data exhibited in Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_b} (c) and Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_b} (d) indicates that rf reflectometry yields essentially equivalent results to LF conductance, although with a dramatic reduction of data-acquisition time. For instance, a 2D map of $V_{L}$ versus V$_{\textrm{LP}}$ consisting of $3000 \times 1500$ points (Appendix \ref{sec:majo_A}) requires roughly \SI{1}{\hour} of acquisition time, including data processing. The acquisition of comparable data using LF lock-in methods with a \SI{30}{\milli\second} integration time would require $1500\times3000\times30 \si{\milli\second} \sim \SI{38}{\hour}$ to achieve a comparable SNR and resolution.

\subsection{Charge sensing}
The charge sensing of a Majorana island is accomplished by placing a second NW (sensor wire), without a superconducting layer, next to the hybrid-NW Majorana device, and capacitively coupling the two NWs with a floating metallic gate \cite{charge_sensing1}. Charge sensing complements conductance and is the basis of parity read-out in several theoretical proposals (e.g., Ref.~\cite{AasenPRX16}). The approach is similar to schemes used for spin qubit read-out \cite{floatinggate,PhysRevApplied.4.014018,charge_sensing2}. In the context of topological qubits, one can generalize the idea used in spin qubits known as "spin-to-charge conversion", where a well-isolated quantum variable (spin) is read out projectively by mapping the relevant qubit state onto charge and then detecting charge \cite{petta,RevModPhys.79.1217}. In a similar way, the parity of a Majorana island grounded via a trivial superconductor, a well-isolated quantum state, can be read out projectively as a charge state if the island is gated into isolation, forming a topological Coulomb island \cite{AasenPRX16}, a process that we denote "parity-to-charge conversion".

\subsubsection{LF charge sensing}
A Majorana island formed from a gated segment of InAs/Al that gates $L$ and $R$ encapsulate, with extended leads made from the same wire (device B), is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_c} (b). Regions with tunable carrier density and conductance, made by removing the Al shell, are aligned with electrostatic gates deposited in a subsequent lithography step. Local depletion of the charge carriers in these regions (tuned by gates $L$ and $R$) creates two superconductor-insulator-superconductor tunnel junctions with a semiconductor-superconductor island in between. A T-shaped floating gate couples the superconducting island to the charge sensor NW, which was operated in the Coulomb blockade regime by depleting its barriers with gate voltage $V_{L}^{(S)}$ and $V_{R}^{(S)}$ (see Appendix \ref{sec:majo_D} for details).

\begin{figure}

	\caption[Charge sensing of a superconducting island]{(a) Conductance through device B, the InAs/Al nanowire device shaded blue in (b), as a function of the bias voltage, $V_\textrm{bias}$, and the compensated plunger voltage, $V_{P}^{*}$.

	\label{fig:majo_c}
\end{figure}

LF lock-in  measurement of conductance through the InAs/Al NW island as a function of $V_\textrm{bias}$ and compensated gate voltage $V_{P}^{*}$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_c} (a). Compensation means that whenever the device plunger voltage $V_{P}$ is swept, the sensor plunger $V_{P}^{(S)}$ is also varied to prevent $V_{P}$ from affecting the sensor charge state via capacitive coupling, allowing the sensor to remain on a single Coulomb peak as $V_{P}^{*}$ is swept. Compensation is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_c} (c), where the green dashed line shows a compensated trajectory through the space of the two plunger voltages.

Coulomb blockade diamonds are visible in Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_c} (a). The suppression of conductance for $|V_\textrm{bias}| < \SI{0.4}{\milli\volt}$, independent of $V_{P}^{*}$, reflects the presence of a superconducting gap in both leads, and is consistent with the gap of Al, assuming the induced gap $\Delta_I \sim \SI{0.2}{\meV}$ is roughly equal in the three NW segments. Charging energy $E_C \sim \SI{0.7}{\meV}$ was extracted from Coulomb diamonds of Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_c} (a). The large charging energy, $E_C/\Delta_I > 1$ is consistent with suppressed conductance of Cooper pairs at $V_\textrm{bias} = \SI{0}{\milli\volt}$ \cite{Joyez1994, Matveev1993, Lotkhov2003}. The large $E_C$ results from the small capacitance between device island and the metal back-gate due to thick (\SI{500}{\nano\meter}) \ce{SiO2}. By comparison, Device A had \SI{200}{\nano\meter} of \ce{SiO2}, reducing the charging energy to below the induced gap, leading to $2e$ Cooper-pair transport between Coulomb valleys.

The sensor conductance, $g^{(S)}$, at zero DC bias, $V_\textrm{bias}^{(S)} = \SI{0}{\milli\volt}$, as a function of plunger gate voltages $V_{P}^{(S)}$ and $V_{P}$, is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_c} (c). Conductance oscillations along the $V_{P}^{(S)}$ axis indicate that the sensor island is tuned into the Coulomb blockade regime, whereas discontinuities along $V_{P}$ reflect charge transitions in the main hybrid device. We emphasize that charge transitions are \emph{not visible} in zero-bias conductance of the device [Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_c} (a)] but \emph{are visible} as plateaus in sensor conductance $g^{(S)}$ as the device charge changes by two between adjacent Coulomb valleys [Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_c} (c) and Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_c} (d)].

\subsubsection{RF charge sensing}

(d) Charge occupancy of the right island (controlled by $V_{RP}$) evolution as a function of $B$.

Periodicity change from $2e$ to $1e$ in $V_{RP}$ direction is observed as $B$ is increased.}
	\label{fig:majo_d}
\end{figure}

A double-Majorana-island (white dashed boxes indicate Al islands) device motived by Ref.~\cite{AasenPRX16} (Device C) is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_d} (a). Near the main device, two bare InAs NWs, capacitively coupled to each of the islands via floating gates, serve as independent charge sensors of the two islands. Each sensor is part of an independent RF circuit, with $L_{1} = \SI{3.3}{\micro\henry}$ ($f_{\rm res} \sim \SI{60}{\mega\hertz}$) and $L_{2} = \SI{4.7}{\micro\henry}$ ($f_{\rm res} \sim \SI{40}{\mega\hertz}$). Data acquisition used method (3), described above. Gates $V_{L}$, $V_{M}$, and $V_{R}$ were each set to the tunneling regime. Voltages applied to plunger gates $LP$ and $RP$ affect both the carrier density in the semiconductor and the charge offset of each island (see Appendix \ref{sec:majo_D}). Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_d} (b) shows the charge sensing signal of a $2e$-$2e$ periodic superconducting double-island at $B = \SI{0}{\tesla}$, measured using the right charge sensor (S2), with a plane subtracted to remove cross-coupling of the plungers to the three barrier gates, $V_{L}$, $V_{M}$ and $V_{R}$.  Periodic $1e$-$1e$ double-island plane-fitted data, measured using the left charge sensor (S1) at finite magnetic field ($B = \SI{0.8}{\tesla}$) parallel to NW axis, is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_d} (c). A hexagonal pattern, characteristic of a double-island devices, is readily seen at both zero field and $B = \SI{0.8}{\tesla}$  [Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_d} (b) and Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_d} (c)]. Magnetic field $B$ evolution of the right $2e$ periodic island into the $1e$ periodic island regime, with the left island tuned into a Coulomb valley, is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_d} (d). The data is differentiated along $V_{RP}$ to improve visibility of the charge transitions.

Previous works \cite{AlbretchNature,sherman} investigated nearly $1e$ periodic island charge occupancy, consistent with an emerging topological phase, using conductance. Using reflectometry and charge instead has  the advantage of not require electron transport through the  device itself. As seen from Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_d} (d), sensing is consistent with these previous transport studies \cite{AlbretchNature}. We will not focus on peak spacing and motion here, to keep the focus on measurement methods.

\subsubsection{Fast charge measurement and signal-to-noise ratios in the \texorpdfstring{$1e$}{1e} regime}

The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for detecting the transfer of a single electron between islands of the double-island device in Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_d} (a) was investigated as a function of measurement time using the pulsed gate sequence shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_e} (a). Measurements were done in an applied axial magnetic field $B = \SI{0.6}{\tesla}$, where the charge-stability diagram shows $1e$-$1e$ hexagons. However, in contrast to the tuning in Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_d} (c), $V_{L}$ and $V_{R}$ were set to isolate the double-island, with negligible coupling to the source and drain. Only inter-island transitions [white and red dashed lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_e} (a)] were measurable in this configuration.

A cyclic pulse sequence was applied to gates $LP$ and $RP$ using an arbitrary waveform generator (Tektronix 5014C), placing the system in three configurations, Initialization (I) for \SI{150}{\micro\second}, Preparation (P) for \SI{200}{\micro\second}, and Measurement (M) for a range of times from \SIrange{1}{50}{\micro\second}  [see Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_e} (a) inset and Appendix \ref{sec:majo_C} for details]. The preparation position and duration were chosen to yield roughly equal populations of relaxed and exited populations, which also depended sensitively on the inter-island barrier gate voltage, $V_{M}$. Results of the measurement, integrated over the measurement time, were then binned to form histograms showing the distinguishability of $N$ and $N+2$ charge-difference states ($N = N_{L} - N_{R}$ is the charge difference, where $N_{L}$ and $N_{R}$ are the occupancies of the left and right islands). Note that the number of cycles used to gather histogram statistics does not affect the distinguishability of the two states. More cycles yield a convergence of the histogram to a stable, smooth bimodal distribution. On the other hand, distinguishability of the two populations is affected by the duration at the measurement (M) point. We note that only during the measurement point ($M$) readout was done by triggering the waveform digitizer card [see Appendix \ref{sec:majo_C} for details].

	\caption[Charge sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio]{(a) $1e$-$1e$ periodic double-island charge stability diagram at $B = \SI{0.6}{\tesla}$ measured using the right proximal charge sensor. The main device was configured such that tunneling to the left/right lead reservoirs is negligible. Only the inter-island transitions are visible with red and white dashed lines. The relative charge occupancy of the islands is marked as $N$, $N+2$ and $N+4$. The pulse sequence used to characterize signal-to-noise ratio is shown in the inset (see main text and Appendix \ref{sec:majo_C} for description), with positions I, M and P indicated on the charge stability diagram that pulsed gates $LP$ and $RP$ move the system to different gate space positions for a given amount of time.

	\label{fig:majo_e}
\end{figure}

The resulting histogram after $10^{8}$ cycles was fit with a sum of two gaussians,

\begin{equation}
\label{gaussians}
P(V_\textrm{rf}^{(S2)} = A_{N}\exp\left(-\frac{\left(V_{\rm rf}^{(S2)}-\mu_{N}\right)^{2}}{2\sigma_{N}^{2}}\right)
						+ A_{N+2}\exp\left(\frac{-\left(V_{\rm rf}^{(S2)}-\mu_{N+2}\right)^{2}}{2\sigma_{N+2}^{2}}\right)
\end{equation}

where $A$, $\mu$, $\sigma$ are the amplitudes, means, and standard deviations of the $N$ and $N+2$ charge differences. Measured distributions and best fits to Eq.~\eqref{gaussians} for measurement times $\tau = \SI{1}{\micro\second}$ and $\tau = \SI{5}{\micro\second}$ are shown in the Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_e} (b). Separation of the two peaks, $\Delta V$, reflects the sensitivity of the charge sensor, while peak widths $\sigma_{N}$ and $\sigma_{N+2}$ result from measurement noise. We define:
\begin{align}
	\textrm{SNR} = \frac{\Delta V}{\sigma} && (\textrm{where }\sigma^{2} = \sigma_{N}^2+\sigma_{N+2}^2)
\end{align}
Note that Eq.~\eqref{gaussians} does not include relaxation from $N$ to $N+2$ during the measurement. A more complicated form that includes relaxation during measurement was investigated in Ref.~\cite{barthel2009rapid}. In the present case, where $\tau$ is much shorter than the charge relaxation time, as set by $V_{M}$, Eq.~\eqref{gaussians} is valid. The measured SNR as a function of measurement time $\tau$ is shown on the left axis of Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_e} (c). An $\textrm{SNR} > 3$ with an integration time of \SI{1}{\micro\second} was achieved.

Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_e} (c) shows that SNR increased with measurement time, $\tau$, as expected. The simplest model of this dependence, assuming uncorrelated noise \cite{sensingdot}, is:
\begin{equation}
	\textrm{SNR}(\tau) = \frac{\Delta V}{\sigma(\SI{1}{\micro\second})}\left(\frac{\tau+\tau_{0}}{\SI{1}{\micro\second}}\right)^{1/2}
\end{equation}
By using fit parameter $\Delta V = \SI{175.3}{\milli\volt}$, $\tau_{0} = \SI{1.5}{\micro\second}$ and $\sigma(\SI{1}{\micro\second}) = \SI{74.8}{\milli\volt}$, the model yields the curve shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_e} (c), which compares well with the experimentally measured $\textrm{SNR}(\tau)$ in the range \SIrange{1}{10}{\micro\second}. Another quantity that characterizes the quality of detection is the visibility, $V$, defined as the probability of correctly identifying excited and ground states ($N$ and $N+2$) and is expressed as $V = F_{N} + F_{N+2} - 1$, where $F_{N}$ and $F_{N+2}$ are the fidelities calculated following \cite{barthel2009rapid} (see Appendix \ref{sec:majo_C} for details). The resulting dependence of visibility on measurement time, $V(\tau)$, is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:majo_e} (c), where again effect of relaxation during measurement are neglected. We find $\sigma(\SI{1}{\micro\second}) = 0.998$. These results are comparable to previously reported charge detection studies \cite{PhysRevApplied.11.044061,spin6,sens2,sens3,rf_nw2}.

\subsection{Conclusions}

In summary, we have investigated RF charge sensing and readout of various InAs/Al nanowire devices relevant for Majorana qubits. Two readout types were studied: First, resonant circuits were directly coupled to the device lead, yielding an improvement in measurement time by a factor of 40 compared to conventional lock-in measurements. Second, charge sensing via a second nanowire capacitively coupled via floating gate to the device allowed charge occupancy in the device to read-out non-invasively and even when visible transport is suppressed through the device. As an application, we followed the evolution of Coulomb charging from $2e$ periodicity to $1e$ periodicity as an axial magnetic field was increased from 0 to 0.6 T, complementing previous conductance measurement of Majorana signatures, without needing to run current through the device. Sensor quality as a function of measurement time was investigated using a pulse sequence that cycled the charge occupancies of the islands. Signal to noise ratio exceeding 3 can be achieved for integration times of \SI{1}{\micro\second} with visibility $V = 99.8\%$. Presented results show that rf resonant circuits, both directly coupled to the device, or to proximal capacitive sensors, can be used for fast and detailed characterization that conventional low-frequency techniques are not able to provide.
